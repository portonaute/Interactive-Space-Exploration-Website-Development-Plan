                        <p>SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets have revolutionized space launch by demonstrating reliable first-stage recovery and reuse, dramatically reducing launch costs. Blue Origin's New Shepard has also achieved reusability for suborbital flights.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key Example:</strong> The Falcon 9 booster B1051 completed 10 successful launches and landings between 2019 and 2021.</p>

                        <p>Large networks of small satellites are being deployed to provide global internet coverage and Earth observation capabilities. These constellations operate in low Earth orbit and work together as a system.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key Example:</strong> Starlink has launched over 2,000 satellites and aims to provide high-speed internet access worldwide.</p>

                        <h3>Reusable Launch Vehicles</h3>
                        <p>The development of reusable launch vehicles represents one of the most significant advances in modern spaceflight. Traditional rockets were single-use, with all components either burning up in the atmosphere or becoming space debris after one mission. This approach made spaceflight extremely expensive, with launch costs exceeding $10,000 per kilogram to orbit.</p>
                        <p>SpaceX pioneered practical reusability with its Falcon 9 rocket, which can land its first stage either on land or on autonomous drone ships at sea. This innovation has reduced launch costs by approximately 30% compared to expendable rockets. The company's Falcon Heavy, essentially three Falcon 9 first stages strapped together, can deliver larger payloads while maintaining partial reusability.</p>
                        <p>Blue Origin, founded by Amazon's Jeff Bezos, has developed the New Shepard system for suborbital tourism and research flights. The company is also working on the New Glenn orbital rocket, designed for reusability from the outset. Other companies and space agencies, including United Launch Alliance, Rocket Lab, and the European Space Agency, are developing their own reusable systems.</p>

                        <h3>Next-Generation Spacecraft</h3>
                        <p>Modern spacecraft design has evolved significantly beyond the capsules and shuttles of the 20th century. SpaceX's Crew Dragon represents a new generation of crew transport vehicles, featuring touchscreen controls, autonomous docking capabilities, and a sleek, modern aesthetic. Boeing's Starliner, though delayed in development, offers similar capabilities with a different approach.</p>
                        <p>For deep space exploration, NASA is developing the Orion spacecraft as part of its Artemis program to return humans to the Moon. Orion is designed to support crews for up to 21 days of active operations, plus 6 months quiescent in space. It incorporates lessons learned from Apollo while adding modern technology.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the most ambitious next-generation spacecraft is SpaceX's Starship, designed to be fully reusable and capable of carrying up to 100 people to the Moon or Mars. With in-space refueling, Starship could revolutionize deep space exploration and potentially enable the establishment of permanent human settlements beyond Earth.</p>

                        <h3>Satellite Constellations</h3>
                        <p>The concept of satellite constellations—networks of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of satellites working together—has transformed space-based services. These constellations typically operate in low Earth orbit (LEO), providing advantages in latency and coverage compared to traditional geostationary satellites.</p>
                        <p>Starlink, developed by SpaceX, aims to provide global broadband internet access with a constellation that could eventually include over 30,000 satellites. OneWeb and Amazon's Project Kuiper are developing competing systems. These constellations promise to bring high-speed internet to remote and underserved areas worldwide.</p>
                        <p>Earth observation constellations like Planet's fleet of "Dove" satellites can image the entire Earth's landmass daily at 3-5 meter resolution. This capability enables applications from monitoring deforestation and agricultural yields to tracking shipping and infrastructure development in near-real-time.</p>

                        <h3>Space Stations</h3>
                        <p>The International Space Station (ISS) represents the most ambitious international collaboration in space history. Continuously occupied since November 2000, the ISS serves as a laboratory for microgravity research across biology, physics, astronomy, and human physiology. It also functions as a testbed for technologies needed for long-duration spaceflight.</p>
                        <p>China has established its own space station, Tiangong, which achieved initial operational capability in 2022. Though smaller than the ISS, Tiangong demonstrates China's growing capabilities in human spaceflight and provides a platform for Chinese research in orbit.</p>
                        <p>Looking to the future, commercial space stations are under development. Axiom Space plans to attach modules to the ISS initially, then separate to form an independent commercial station when the ISS is retired. Blue Origin and Sierra Space are developing "Orbital Reef," envisioned as a "mixed-use business park in space" that could support research, manufacturing, tourism, and other commercial activities.</p>

                        <p>Mars exploration has accelerated dramatically in the 21st century, with multiple nations sending increasingly sophisticated missions to the Red Planet. NASA's Mars rovers—Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance—have progressively expanded our understanding of Martian geology, climate history, and potential for past habitability.</p>
                        <p>Perseverance, which landed in 2021, represents the most advanced rover yet deployed. It carries instruments to search for signs of ancient microbial life and is collecting samples for eventual return to Earth. The mission also included Ingenuity, a small helicopter that demonstrated the first powered flight on another planet.</p>
                        <p>China's Tianwen-1 mission successfully placed both an orbiter and the Zhurong rover on Mars in 2021, making China only the second nation to operate a rover on the Martian surface. The United Arab Emirates' Hope orbiter, also arriving in 2021, is studying Mars' atmosphere and weather patterns.</p>

                        <h3>Deep Space Missions</h3>
                        <p>Beyond Mars, robotic missions continue to explore the outer solar system and beyond. NASA's Juno spacecraft is studying Jupiter's atmosphere, magnetic field, and internal structure. The New Horizons mission provided the first close-up images of Pluto in 2015 and later encountered Arrokoth, the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft.</p>
                        <p>The European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) and NASA's Europa Clipper will investigate Jupiter's potentially habitable moons in the coming decade. These missions will search for subsurface oceans and assess the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>
                        <p>In astronomy, the James Webb Space Telescope represents a quantum leap in our ability to observe distant objects. Positioned at the L2 Lagrange point 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, Webb's 6.5-meter primary mirror and infrared instruments allow it to study the earliest galaxies, exoplanet atmospheres, and the formation of stars and planetary systems.</p>
